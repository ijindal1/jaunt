Output Python code only (no markdown, no fences).

Implement `{{generated_module}}` for specs from `{{spec_module}}`.

Required top-level names (must exist): {{expected_names}}

Specs:
{{specs_block}}

Dependency APIs (callable signatures/docstrings):
{{deps_api_block}}

Previously generated dependency modules (for reference only):
{{deps_generated_block}}

Extra error context (fix these issues):
{{error_context_block}}

Rules:
- Do not generate tests.
- Do not edit user files; only output generated module source code.
