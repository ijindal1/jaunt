title: "@jaunt.test Specs"
description: Write test intent as stubs that Jaunt turns into real pytest tests.
---

Test specs are *not real tests*. They are stubs that describe what the generated tests should do.

Rules:

- Must be **top-level** functions.
- Name them like pytest tests (`test_*`) so the *generated* versions are collected by pytest.
- `@jaunt.test` sets `__test__ = False` on the stub so pytest will not collect the stub itself.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import jaunt

from my_app import specs


@jaunt.test()
def test_normalize_email__lowercases_and_strips() -> None:
    """
    Assert normalize_email:
    - strips surrounding whitespace
    - lowercases
    - raises ValueError for invalid inputs like "no-at-sign"

    Examples:
    - specs.normalize_email("  A@B.COM  ") == "a@b.com"
    """
    raise AssertionError("spec stub (generated at test time)")
```

Jaunt generates a module under `tests/__generated__/...` with top-level test functions matching your stub names.
