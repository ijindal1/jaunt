title: Configuration (jaunt.toml)
description: Config keys and behavior.
---

Jaunt discovers the project root by walking upward from the current working directory until it finds `jaunt.toml`.

Minimal config:

```toml
version = 1

[paths]
source_roots = ["src"]
test_roots = ["tests"]
generated_dir = "__generated__"
```

Full config (all keys optional except `version`):

```toml
version = 1

[paths]
source_roots = ["src", "."]
test_roots = ["tests"]
generated_dir = "__generated__"

[llm]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-5.2"
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

[build]
jobs = 8
infer_deps = true

[test]
jobs = 4
infer_deps = true
pytest_args = ["-q"]

[prompts]
build_system = ""
build_module = ""
test_system = ""
test_module = ""
```

Notes:

- `paths.source_roots`: the CLI picks the *first existing* source root as the output base for generated build modules.
- `prompts.*` are treated as *file paths* and read at runtime by the OpenAI backend.
