description: Spec-driven code generation for Python.

Jaunt is a small Python library + CLI for **spec-driven code generation**:

- You write **intent** as normal Python functions/classes decorated with `@jaunt.magic(...)`.
- You optionally write **test intent** as Python stubs decorated with `@jaunt.test(...)`.
- Jaunt uses an LLM backend (currently OpenAI) to generate real modules under `__generated__/`.
- You review the generated output and iterate by editing the specs and rerunning generation.
