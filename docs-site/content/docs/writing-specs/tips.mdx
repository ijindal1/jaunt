You don't "use Jaunt" once. You live in a loop: **write spec → build → review → tighten spec → rebuild**.

## Iterating On Specs

This loop IS the development process:

1. Write a spec with your best guess at the contract.
2. Run `jaunt build`.
3. Read the generated code. Does it match your intent?
4. If not: tighten the docstring, add edge cases, use `prompt=` for constraints.
5. Re-run `jaunt build`. Jaunt only regenerates what changed.

You'll usually get 80% right on the first pass. The second pass — where you name the edge cases you forgot — is where the spec gets good. Don't try to write the perfect spec upfront. Iterate.

## Vague vs. Precise Docstrings

Bad (vague):

```python
@jaunt.magic()
def parse_user_agent(ua: str) -> dict:
    """Parse a user agent string."""
    raise RuntimeError("spec stub (generated at build time)")
```

Better (contract):

```python
@jaunt.magic()
def parse_user_agent(ua: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    """
    Parse a user agent string into a small, stable dict.

    Contract:
    - Return keys: "browser", "os".
    - If unknown, use "unknown" (do not raise).
    - Input may be empty or junk; treat as unknown.
    """
    raise RuntimeError("spec stub (generated at build time)")
```

The difference: the vague spec leaves every decision to the LLM. The precise spec names the return shape, the failure mode, and the edge case. Better spec → better code → less iteration.

## Use `prompt=` When The Docstring Isn't Enough

If a constraint is non-negotiable, say it twice:

```python
@jaunt.magic(prompt="Use only the standard library. Do not import third-party deps.")
def stable_hash(text: str) -> str:
    """Return a stable hex sha256 of UTF-8 text."""
    raise RuntimeError("spec stub (generated at build time)")
```

Good uses of `prompt=`:

- Force a specific library: `prompt="Use the cryptography library, not hashlib."`
- Architectural constraints: `prompt="Must be async-safe. No global state."`
- Style preferences: `prompt="Prefer explicit loops over list comprehensions for readability."`

## Don't Edit Generated Files

Generated output is disposable. Specs are the product.

If you need a behavior change, change the spec and rebuild so your intent is versioned. Editing `__generated__/` files directly means your changes will be overwritten on the next build.

## When Not To Use Jaunt

Jaunt is best for glue code and boring-but-correct utilities (parsers, validators, formatters).

Avoid it (for now) for:

- performance-critical hot paths
- complex stateful systems with tight invariants
- code that depends on exact library versions or fragile runtime behavior
