description: "How to write test intent stubs that Jaunt turns into real pytest tests."
---

`@jaunt.test` specs are not tests. They’re **descriptions of tests**. Jaunt generates real pytest tests under `tests/__generated__/`.

## Rules

- Must be **top-level** functions.
- Name them like pytest tests (`test_*`) so generated tests are collected.
- The stub itself is marked `__test__ = False` so pytest won’t collect it.

## Annotated Example

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import jaunt


@jaunt.test()
def test_normalize_email__lowercases_and_strips() -> None:
    """
    Assert normalize_email:
    - strips surrounding whitespace
    - lowercases
    - rejects invalid inputs like "no-at-sign" (ValueError)

    Concrete assertions (write these out, don’t imply them):
    - normalize_email("  A@B.COM  ") == "a@b.com"
    """
    raise AssertionError("spec stub (generated at test time)")
```

## Tips That Make Generated Tests Better

- **Be explicit about assertions**: write `X == Y` in the docstring.
- **Name edge cases**: empty strings, invalid formats, boundary values.
- **Import the thing you’re testing** inside the docstring or stub body if needed. The generator tends to do better when it sees the intended import path.

## Running

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src jaunt test
```
