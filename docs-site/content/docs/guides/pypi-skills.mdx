title: Auto-Generated PyPI Skills (Build)
description: Jaunt can generate “skills” from your project’s external imports and inject them into the build prompt.
---

Jaunt adds a pre-build step to `jaunt build` that (best-effort) generates and injects **skills** for the external libraries your project imports.

## What It Does

On every `jaunt build`:

- Scans `paths.source_roots` for Python imports (`import ...` and `from ... import ...`).
- Filters out:
  - stdlib modules
  - project-internal top-level modules
  - relative imports (`from .foo import ...`)
- Resolves the remaining imports to installed **PyPI distributions + versions** (from your current environment).
- Ensures there is exactly one skill per distribution at:
  - `<project_root>/.agents/skills/<dist-normalized>/SKILL.md`
- Fetches the README for the exact `<dist>==<version>` from PyPI, then uses an OpenAI “skills generator” to produce `SKILL.md`.
- Concatenates all generated skills into a single block and injects it into the build LLM prompt so the builder can use accurate library patterns.

If any piece fails (resolution, PyPI fetch, generation, write), Jaunt prints a warning and continues building without those missing skills.

## Where Skills Are Stored

Skills are stored inside your project:

```text
<project_root>/
  .agents/
    skills/
      requests/
        SKILL.md
      pydantic/
        SKILL.md
```

The directory name is the distribution name normalized like PyPI (lowercased; `-`, `_`, `.` treated consistently).

## Safe Overwrites (When Jaunt Regenerates)

Jaunt will only overwrite a skill file if it was previously generated by Jaunt and the installed version changed.

- Generated files start with a header like:
  - `<!-- jaunt:skill=pypi dist=<dist> version=<version> -->`
- If a file has **no header**, it is treated as user-managed and is never overwritten.

## What Gets Injected Into The Build Prompt

During build generation, Jaunt injects an extra user message before the normal module prompt:

- `External library skills (reference):`
- followed by a concatenated block like:
  - `## <dist>==<version>`
  - skill content (header removed to reduce noise)

This gives the code generator concrete, library-specific usage patterns and gotchas.

## Security Note (Prompt Injection Hygiene)

PyPI READMEs are treated as **untrusted input**. The skill generator is instructed to ignore “instructions” inside READMEs and only extract factual usage and API patterns.

## Troubleshooting

- Want to see it in action quickly? Try the runnable example:
  - `.venv/bin/python examples/run_example.py pydantic test`

- “It didn’t generate a skill”: the import might be stdlib or internal, the dist might not be installed, or the README fetch/generation might have failed. Jaunt should emit a warning but still proceed with the build.
- “Wrong version”: skills are keyed to what’s installed in the environment running `jaunt build`. Update your environment, rerun build, and Jaunt should refresh generated skills.
